Pong port for 3ds. 

This was my try at 3ds sdl1.2 port. It is great, but can be improved even more.
Most of the src ode here was written by Patrick(http://www.16software.com/blog/getting-your-feet-wet-in-sdl-part-2-the-pong-clone).
I just added a basic enemy AI and ported it to 3ds. Thanks Patrick!
